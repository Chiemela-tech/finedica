1. Types of Mortgages Available in the UK 
a)  Fixed-Rate Mortgage  
○  The interest rate stays the same for a set period (for example, 2, 5, or 10 
years).  
○  Monthly payments stay the same during this time.  
○  Often starts with a slightly higher rate compared to variable options.  
b)  Variable-Rate Mortgage  
○  The interest rate can go up or down depending on changes by the lender.  
○  Monthly payments can increase or decrease.  
○  Usually based on the lender’s own standard interest rate.  
c)  Tracker Mortgage  
○  The interest rate follows the Bank of England base rate, plus a set 
percentage.  
○  If the base rate goes up or down, your interest rate and payments will change 
in line with it.  
○  Clear to understand, but there is a risk of rising payments.  
d)  Discounted Variable-Rate Mortgage  
○  Offers a discount off the lender’s standard interest rate for a set period.  
○  Starts with lower payments.  
○  Payments can still change if the lender’s standard rate changes.  
e)  Offset Mortgage  
○  Links your savings account to your mortgage balance.  
○  You only pay interest on the difference between your mortgage and your 
savings.  
○  Flexible option, but your savings will not earn separate interest.  
f)  Guarantor Mortgage  
○  A family member (often a parent) guarantees the mortgage.  
○  Useful if you have a small deposit or a lower income.  
○  The guarantor’s savings or property may be at risk if you cannot keep up with 
repayments.  
g)  Shared Ownership Mortgage  
○  Allows you to buy a share of a property (for example, 25%–75%) and pay rent 
on the remaining share.  
○  Mortgage needed only for the part you own.  
○  Makes buying a home more affordable but rent can increase over time.  
h)  Help to Buy Equity Loan (ended March 2023)  
○  The government provided a loan of up to 20% of the property value (up to 
40% in London) for new-build homes.  
○  Buyers needed only a 5% deposit.  
○  You must repay the loan, with interest added after five years.  
○  Note: The national scheme has ended, but local or regional schemes may 
still exist.  
i)  Joint Borrower, Sole Proprietor Mortgage  
○  Allows you to use the income of family members to help you borrow more 
without giving them ownership of the property.  
○  Helps you increase your borrowing amount without extra property taxes for 
second homes.  
 
2. Key Points First-Time Buyers Should Consider 
a)  Deposit Size  
○  Minimum deposit is usually 5% of the property price.  
○  A deposit of 10% or more gives access to better interest rates.  
○  A 20% to 25% deposit usually gets the best deals.  
b)  Mortgage Term (Length of the Loan)  
○  A longer term, such as 30 or 40 years, reduces monthly payments but means 
you pay more interest overall.  
○  A shorter term has higher monthly payments but costs less in total interest.  
c)  Affordability  
○  Lenders check your income, debts, and living costs to decide how much you 
can borrow.  
○  Always be realistic about what monthly payments you can afford, especially if 
interest rates rise.  
d)  Interest Rates  
○  Fixed-rate mortgages give certainty about payments.  
○  Variable-rate mortgages could save you money if rates fall but can become 
more expensive if rates rise.  
e)  Fees  
○  Expect to pay for arrangement fees, valuation fees, and legal fees.  
○  Fees can add up to between £1,000 and £2,000 or more.  
○  Sometimes it is better to choose a mortgage with no fees, even if the interest 
rate is slightly higher.  
f)  Credit Score  
○  A strong credit score helps you get better mortgage deals.  
○  Check your credit report and improve it before applying if needed.  
g)  Government Schemes  
○  Check if you are eligible for schemes like Shared Ownership or First Homes.  
○  These can make buying more affordable.  
h)  Overpayment Options  
○  Some mortgages allow you to pay more than your required monthly payment 
without penalties.  
○  Overpaying can reduce your mortgage term and the total interest you pay.  
i)  Insurance  
○  Buildings insurance is required to protect the property.  
○  Life insurance and income protection insurance are worth considering to 
protect your home if your circumstances change.  
j)  Early Repayment Charges  
○  Some fixed-rate and tracker mortgages charge a penalty if you repay early or 
move before the deal ends.  
○  Check these charges if you think you might move house or repay the loan 
early.  
k)  Future Plans  
○  Think about how long you plan to stay in the property.  
○  A mortgage deal with heavy penalties for early exit could be costly if you 
move sooner than expected.

4. Mortgage First Steps Checklist for Beginners 
a). Check Your Credit Score 
●  Look at your credit report (use Experian, Equifax, or TransUnion).  
●  Fix any mistakes.  
●  Pay off small debts if possible to improve your score.  
b). Start Saving for a Deposit 
●  Aim for at least 5% of the property price.  
●  10%-20% is better to unlock cheaper mortgage rates.  
●  Set up a dedicated savings account (for example, a Lifetime ISA if eligible).  
c). Work Out How Much You Can Afford 
●  List your monthly income and expenses.  
●  Use a mortgage calculator to estimate what repayments you can comfortably 
manage.  
●  Remember to leave room for emergencies and future interest rate rises.  
d). Understand Extra Costs 
●  Budget for legal fees, valuation fees, mortgage arrangement fees, moving costs, and 
stamp duty (if applicable).  
●  Costs can easily add £2,000–£5,000+ on top of the deposit.  
e). Research Mortgage Types 
●  Learn the basics of fixed-rate, tracker, variable-rate, and offset mortgages (see earlier 
list).  
●  Think about whether you want stable payments or are happy with some risk.  
f). Explore Government Schemes 
●  Check if you qualify for Shared Ownership, First Homes, or local support programs.  
●  Some schemes help with lower deposits or discounted properties.  
g). Get an Agreement in Principle (Optional) 
●  This is a statement from a lender showing how much they might lend you.  
●  Helps show estate agents and sellers that you are serious.  
h). Choose a Good Mortgage Adviser or Broker (Optional but helpful)

●  Some charge a fee; others get paid by the lender.  
i). Start Viewing Properties 
●  Stay within your budget.  
●  Remember: the cheapest monthly payment isn’t always the best overall deal.  
j). Apply for a Full Mortgage Offer 
●  Once you have an offer accepted on a property, complete a full mortgage application.  
●  The lender will carry out a full credit check, valuation, and affordability assessment.
